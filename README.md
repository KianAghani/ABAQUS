# ABAQUS
This Python-based ABAQUS plugin is designed to simplify and automate the process of defining CDP material properties in finite element simulations. It provides a user-friendly interface to input key CDP parameters, ensuring accurate and consistent modeling of concrete behavior under various loading conditions.

The plugin eliminates manual errors in defining damage, plasticity, and hardening laws. Moreover, the plugin is based on the equation provided by FIP model code 2010 and includes calibrated parameters. It also inputs the *elastic option in ABAQUS.

This plugin streamlines the process, reducing setup time and improving reliability.

An advanced, automated version is available in:

The package conforms with CEB-FIP model code 2010 for concrete.
